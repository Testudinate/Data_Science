3: Variables

Variables are a fundamental building block of most programming languages. We use variables to store values
that we want to use later. We first select a name for the variable and then assign the variable a value. We
then can refer to that value using the variable name.

For example, if we know we're going to be using the value 10 a lot, we can store the value 10 in a variable
called b. Then whenever we want to refer to that value, we can use b instead of 10. To assign the value 10 
to a new variable named b, you write the desired variable name, add an equals sign (=), and then write the 
value you want that variable to store.

The equals sign (=) is called the assignment operator since it's used to assign the value on the right to 
the variable on the left. In Python, variable names can't have spaces or special characters like * or |.
In general, you should use lower-case characters when naming variables. The one special character you can use is the underscore (_).

In Python, the value assigned to a variable can be modified. You can assign a different value to an existing 
variable and the variable will refer to the new value instead. To assign a new value to the variable b, 
use the same assignment operator (=) along with the name of the variable and the new value you want assigned to it:

After the last line of code, the variable b refers to the value 12.

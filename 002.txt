2: Interface

Each mission is broken up into steps. After you've completed a step, you can use the navigation bar 
on the right to jump back to it. Most steps consist of an explanation of a concept, the instructions 
for completing the exercise correctly, and a section to write and run code to complete the exercise. 
Most code blocks contain existing sample code that demonstrates the idea discussed in that step. You 
should write your code in the lines below the sample code.

When you write code and click Check, we execute the code, and give you feedback on the code. You can
write and run code as many times as you'd like until you get the right answer. If you're stuck, you
can get a hint by clicking on Hint. If you want to see the correct answer and you've made 3 attempts, click Solution.

We'll be coding using the Python programming language because it's friendly for beginners but still incredibly 
powerful for working with data. We'll use the latest version of Python, also known as Python 3.

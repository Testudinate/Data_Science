1: Data science

Data science is about understanding systems, whether they be natural systems, like the climate, or man-made systems, 
like the economy. Scientific experiments have been conducted for centuries, but recent advances in technology enable 
us to utilize data to understand systems at a much larger scale. Individual data points represent snapshots of a 
systems' behavior, and as you collect more data on that system, you build up a dataset that you can use to analyze 
and understand the system. Some examples of datasets include:

    daily stock prices of a public company
    GPS location data of Uber rides
    all of the topics on Wikipedia.org

Data science techniques can be applied to virtually any field. Some high profile examples of applied data science 
include the Netflix prize, where algorithms were developed to predict which movies viewers would enjoy, and the 
Heritage health prize, where algorithms were developed to discover which patients would be hospitalized more often.

To work with data effectively, you need to learn how to program. Software products like Microsoft Excel allow 
you to explore data, but don't scale to larger datasets, don't allow you tweak and run machine learning algorithms,
and make it challenging to reproduce your work. We focus primarily on the Python programming language, which has
emerged as one of the most powerful and popular tools for doing data science. Python is incredibly versatile and 
data scientists and engineers use it to do everything from building complex web applications to analyzing large datasets.

At Dataquest, we're strong believers in learning by doing. You'll work with real datasets and receive feedback 
immediately. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of programming by writing and running Python code at
each step of the way. In this mission, you'll learn the basics of Python, so we can dive into a dataset in the next mission.
